4. Create a file in that folder. Name it about.txt and add a fun fact about yourself. (You can use the command line: touch nameOfTheFile.txt).

command: minhnguyen@Minhs-MBP-2 IronMinh % touch something_about_Minh.txt
(base) minhnguyen@Minhs-MBP-2 IronMinh % echo "20 years old" > something_about_Minh.txt
(base) minhnguyen@Minhs-MBP-2 IronMinh % echo "is a couch potato" >> something_about_Minh.txt
(base) minhnguyen@Minhs-MBP-2 IronMinh % cat something_about_Minh.txt
20 years old
is a couch potato

command: (base) minhnguyen@Minhs-MBP-2 IronMinh % git add something_about_Minh.txt 

(base) minhnguyen@Minhs-MBP-2 IronMinh % git status

Pair Programming Exercise

Pair yourself with a classmate. Send the link of your GitHub repository to your pair via Slack. Now each of you should perform the following set of actions:

1. Fork your classmate's repository.


2. Clone the repository, so that you have it locally and can make changes.

command: minhnguyen@Minhs-MBP-2 Afternoon % git clone https://github.com/MinhNguyen163/IronTim.git


3. Create a new branch named classmate.

command: git switch -c Tim

4. Create a new file with your name (ex. maya.txt) and finish the following sentence I enrolled Ironhack's Data Analytics bootcamp because.... When you are done, save the changes.

command: echo "I enrolled Ironhack's Data Analytics bootcamp because I want to change career to Data Scientist" > minh.txt


5. Add the changes to the git.

command: (base) minhnguyen@Minhs-MBP-2 IronTim % git add minh.txt 

#check: (base) minhnguyen@Minhs-MBP-2 IronTim % git status
On branch Tim
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   minh.txt


6. Commit and push the changes. Now, all the changes should be on your GitHub, inside the forked repository.

#commit:
command: (base) minhnguyen@Minhs-MBP-2 IronTim % git commit -m "added classmate minh.txt"
#output: [Tim 992ecb3] added classmate minh.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 minh.txt


#push the changes:
command: (base) minhnguyen@Minhs-MBP-2 IronTim % git push origin Tim


7. Create a pull request to make changes appear in the original repository.

https://github.com/TimHoogervorst/IronTim/pulls

8.Merge the branch your classmate created. Now everyone's repos should have the original file (about.txt) as well as the new one with your classmate's name.
